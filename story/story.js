It was dark on one side and light on the outer. On one part, the dark side, there was floating rocks. The ground torn, ripped and jagged to walked on. The path was elevating into the air. The sky was red and the clouds were black. I could feel the heat rolling off the stones and rocks as my eyes follow the path there was a black  circle was turning clockwise. when I look closer into the circle I can see a skull trying to poke it hand out. The path on the left was bright. white and transparent was silver roses lining the bridge-like constitution. There were tiny little Thorns that shine so brightly I thought they were diamonds. I took took one and it's poke me on my finger and it was stained with my red blood.",

A young girl looked at you, as you looked around you see yourself surrounded by 12 girls around your age, you felt a sharp pain as you whip your head back to look at the girl in front of you. You see fear and terror in her eyes. The sound of heavy footsteps echoing off the walls. The shadows bounced off the sides of the walls as the shadows got closer. A barley man comes, his voice makes the girls stiffen and crowded against each other for comfort. “ The products this time are better than the last” as he holds your face in his hand. ,

I says as i started walking towards the hill to find out where i am. As I walk slowly but surely I make her way through the soft Grass, the grass brushing against my legs. I openly brushed my skin against the grass, it felt so soft and cool. I walked along the hill to the highest point and I was amazed. I could see flying boats, like the ones in the sea except these were sailing the skies. The boats have wings on the side and they soar through the clouds.oh and the clouds were white as snow and the sky was like a crystal Sapphire, so bright and the sun.

I could see their bones through their skin. The street was made out of dirt, the houses were like iron shacks that were barely keeping themselves up. As I walked further in.
