            Where should I start? Hmmm? The Beginning! My story began when I was walking home from school; 
            It was like the sky was morning for a loss. The clouds were twisted into one another. 
            They were gray, slowly turning into black. The sky turned black, like a dark certain coming to a close. 
            The air was damp and the wind picked up. Blowing cold, icy wind that kissed the earth and cause a shiver to thrive through my body. 
            Ready to burst it's pipes and flood the city. ' Its going to rain. Hard. Great, just great. No umbrella. No nothing! To guard myself with!' I thought, as I walked out the school building. 
            I pulled my backpack over my head to protect me from the rain and started to run home before I get too wet. As soon as I launched into a sprint. 
            The dam that was holding back the water building in the sky finally burst and. It poured and poured and poured and poured. But like the idiot I am, I just continued to run. 
            Passing the school gate into the streets, then running up the hill. Next to the riverbank where I played when I was just a little girl. Laughing to myself, thinking back to that time I ran along that same river. 
            All the fond memories came rushing by. The time I busted my knee and I cried <em>soo</em>much that Rant had to run and get candy for me to calm down while my big brother tended to my knee. 
            When we went home father was red-in-the-face mad! He yelled and redid about how ' his cute and adorable little girl getting hurt and NO ONE tried to help ' then he went on to say ' how brave his handsome son is.' 
            Chuckling to myself. Not looking where I was going, this right here is what happened and here is the part you won't believe even if it happened right in front of you. 
            I slipped on a banana ( I still to this day have no idea were it even came from) and landed in a puddle. Now you thinking that would be so unbelievable about that, 
            well that is not the unbelievable part and to this day I still believe it is impossible. I slipped into a different time zone and reality altogether. 
            This world was <em>sooooooo</em> beautiful that I forgotten how my real world looked like sometimes.
